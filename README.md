## 🎯 About the Project

**ShopHub** is a fully functional frontend clone of Amazon, built to demonstrate proficiency in modern e-commerce UI patterns and core web technologies. From a dynamic hero carousel and category browsing to a fully working shopping cart — all crafted without a single framework or library.

This project was developed as part of a self-driven learning journey to explore real-world UI challenges such as cart state management with vanilla JavaScript, responsive product grids, multi-language support, and interactive component design.
